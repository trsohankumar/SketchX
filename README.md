# SketchX: Sketch to image transformation using generative adverserial networks
## Abstract
This project aims to develop a model that 
can convert sketches into portraits of Indian people using deep image-to-image translation 
techniques. Converting a sketch into a portrait photo is done by implementing a pix2pix 
approach to conditional GANs, with the generator following a U-net architecture and the 
discriminator a PatchGAN. The system is trained on a dataset containing faces of Indian 
people, ensuring that the generated image will also be of Indian origin. The results are 
evaluated based on the Fr√©chet Inception Distance between the real and generated image.
